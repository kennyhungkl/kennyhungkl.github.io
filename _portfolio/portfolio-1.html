<p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image analysis is crucial for accurate diagnostics, but it is often a lengthy process due to a lack of qualified ophthalmologists to conduct thorough evaluations.</p>

<p>Our project focused on applying several cutting-edge machine learning (ML) models to analyze OCT images. Our method involved data augmentation, followed by fine-tuning the models, and then evaluating their performance to identify which one performs best in this context.</p>

<p>Our results indicated that the CoCa (Contrastive Captioning) and ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) models achieved the highest accuracy, which is 99%, compatible with senior doctors in interpreting OCT images. Furthermore, we employed data augmentation techniques, such as generating captions for the OCT images and using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which significantly enhanced the overall performance of the models.</p>
